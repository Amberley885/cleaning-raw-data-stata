## OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (Stata)
## Cleaning Raw Data

This tutorial has two objectives. The first objective is to demonstrate the
process of cleaning a raw data file from start to finish. The second objective
is to demonstrate some features of Stata which are critical for writing
efficient code, and the syntax for a number of commands needed for data
cleaning. The tutorial concludes with a demonstration of how to reshape data
from long to wide format.

You will need to have Stata version 12 or higher installed on your computer to
run this tutorial. Download cleaning_raw_data.zip, and unzip and extract the
files. Start Stata by opening the cleaning_raw_data_XX.do file in the programs
subdirectory, and arrange the do file editor and main Stata windows side by
side so that you can see them both. Work through the tutorial by reading the
comments and running one or several lines of code at a time.
